you could use the function rdbuf to access the u
nderlying buffer. You stream the rdbuf directly to another
stream without copying. But you can not get an point
r to the inner buffer since the rdb
uf does not need to be implemented that way. Howev
er you could implem
ent your own rdbuf which allows access to the inner buffer.
